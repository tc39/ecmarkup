# Generating a PDF from ecmarkup

## Required frontmatter

- In order to produce a PDF, the front matter `title`, `shortname`, and `status` are **mandatory**.
- If using the alternative copyright, `location` is also mandatory.
- If generating a version for submission to the GA, `version` and `date` are mandatory. `date` should reflect the date of the Ecma GA which will ratify the Standard. For example:

```
title: ECMAScriptÂ® 2024 Language Specification
shortname: ECMA-262
version: 15<sup>th</sup> Edition
date: 2024-06-25
```

To generate markup for use in PDF conversion, make sure to include the options `--assets`, `--assets-dir`, and `--printable`. If you have images and styles to include, make sure to move them into your assets directory before running `ecmarkup`. For example:

```shell
mkdir -p out &&
cp -R images out &&
ecmarkup --assets external --assets-dir out --printable spec.html out/index.html
```

Then, from your spec's working directory, run [`prince-books`](https://www.princexml.com/) to generate your PDF.

```shell
cd path/to/spec
prince-books --script ./node_modules/ecmarkup/js/print.js out/index.html -o path/to/output.pdf
```

This has been extensively tested with Prince 15. Earlier and later editions not guaranteed.
